JS Computer
===========

This project is for fun and educational purposes. It aims to simulate the functioning of a CPU using pure JS. Currently it can only process simple programs written in binary. 

TODO

1.  Finish all the logical operations and give them functional bindings in the cpu.js main file    
2.  Integrate the virtual OS and allow storage of long data sequences in memory    
3.  Write an assembly language and compiler to permit the development of even higher level languages
